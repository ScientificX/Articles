Hello,
Here are the postscript files for the 1986 printing of my Denotational
Semantics text.  The files should be assembled in this order:

frontmatter
contents
preface
ch0
ch1
  ...
ch11
ch12
bib


Some caveats:
 ---Some graphics are missing.  Also, you will note the absence
of arcs in derivation trees and semantics derivations in some Figures. 
The text was typeset when graphics tools were not readily available, and the
various graphics that appeared in the hardback version were inserted
by a professional artist.

 ---The version of  troff  I used to develop the text is long dead and gone,
but I salvaged the source and most macros and successfully printed them
with  groff.  This changed the page numbering, making the original index
useless.  So, there's no index---sorry.

 ---I was unable to typeset the bibliograhy satisfactorily, so I included
raw source, since it is better than nothing.


Please send comments to me at   schmidt@cis.ksu.edu

Dave Schmidt
